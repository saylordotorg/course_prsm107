**Unit 2: Preparing for a Crisis** <span id="2"></span> 
*Unit 2 will provide you with specific steps for preparing for a crisis.
This unit begins with an overview that explores how you can use a SWOT
analysis - looking at strengthens, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threats - to assess how a company operates within its environment. As
part of business strategic planning, this unit covers setting goals and
objectives that can also be applied to crisis contingency planning. This
includes learning the basics of preparing a written crisis communication
plan that has been coordinated both internally and externally for a
specific organization or company. The length of the plan depends on the
type and size of the organization, but it should include information
regarding the crisis management team – team members’ names, titles,
phone numbers, and responsibilities for helping execute the plan.
Effective plans should also identify the spokesperson, have
pre-developed key messages, and sample news releases. The plan should
also document media training, other operational training, lessons
learned, and best practices as appropriate. As an example of crisis
communication planning, you will watch a lecture that provides a look
into how the United States’ Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
expanded its crisis management team to include a monthly think tank that
is open to the public for participation and comment.  
    
 Additionally, you will learn about the various roles employees,
leaders, and managers play in crisis management. Because each
organization or company is unique in its size and has a specific
mission, the roles should be modified appropriately. For example, a
large government office may have multiple public affairs specialists
providing information to a central public affairs officer who serves as
the key spokesperson. Each of the subordinate public affairs specialists
may be assigned to work internal, community relations or media relations
areas as part of the overall crisis communication plan. Other management
roles may involve coordinating information for news releases with other
private and government agencies. In this unit, you will learn how a
press conference should be conducted and how the 24/7 digital news
environment affects the need for quick and accurate responses to news
media inquiries. Depending on the type of crisis, it may require roles
and responsibilities involving physical and personal security, personnel
issues handled by human resources, legal counsel for liabilities, and
medical liaisons coordinating information on injuries and deaths. All of
these roles help management make responsible decisions that will help
minimize damage and harm as well as will help in the assessment of when
and how quickly the organization can resume normal daily business
operations.*
