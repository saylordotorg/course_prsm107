*It is no secret that using social media during a crisis is a must.
There have been recent crisis events, such as a natural disaster, where
national and regional government emergency response officials have used
social media, such as Twitter, to keep people informed. Regardless of

real time information during search and rescue efforts, you should learn
how to best use it. This means it is also important to properly
integrate social media into the overall strategic communication plans of
