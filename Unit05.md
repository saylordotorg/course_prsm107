**Unit 5: Developing Strategic Messages** <span id="5"></span> 
*Unit 5 will focus on how to use key messages to tell your company’s
story and how to incorporate key strategic messages in online and
traditional media tools. This unit will also discuss how to help
managers communicate timely, effective, and truthful messages while
adhering to sound business principles.  
    
 Imagine you work for a company that is trying to negotiate with its
union employees for their routine 4 to 6-year contract renewal. Imagine
you are the public relations spokesperson for the second largest company
in the United States and there are few trained spokespersons at your
company, including you. What starts out to be a routine renewal labor
union contract renewal turns bad. As the spokesperson for your company,
what do you do? In 1997, a situation like this occurred when UPS
employees were negotiating their contracts. When talks failed to produce
an agreement that provided more job security through full-time
employment and less part-time employment, without warning, the
Teamster’s Union announces that its UPS employees would go on strike.
This resulted in millions of dollars in lost revenues and expenses.
Approximately two weeks later, in hindsight and with the help of the
case study authors, management reviewed how effective planning and
message development could have resulted in a better outcome. In this
unit, you will find out more about crisis management while reading the
UPS case study.*
