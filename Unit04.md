**Unit 4: Designing a Crisis Communication Plan (CCP)** <span
id="4"></span> 
*There is no one size fits all when it comes to crisis communication
plans (CCP). This is true whether you are designing a CCP for a
government agency, nonprofit organization, or private company. However,
there are some key elements that each CCP is expected to include in the
broad terms of pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis actions. When spelled
out in the CCP, you want to be sure to address pre-crisis preparations,
safety, notifications of key staff, listing the crisis communication
team (CCT), their functions and their contact information, situation
assessments, developing key messages, media releases, and communication
updates. There is always a need to address post-crisis actions such as
evaluating how the CCT performed and lessons learned before starting the
cycle again to prepare for the next crisis.  
    
 In this unit, you will learn about the basic components of the crisis
communication plan and how to develop a CCP in a digital format.
Regardless of the format, the CCP should be coordinated among all
participating agencies and organizations. It should be tested or
practiced to see what works and what does not work so modifications can
be made before you really need to use it.*
