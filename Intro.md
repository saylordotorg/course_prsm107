Course Syllabus for "PRSM107: Crisis Communication"
---------------------------------------------------

Imagine you wake up one morning and read a news flash on your smartphone
or other mobile device that a major fire threatens your office building.
You immediately remember that your organization recently practiced its
quarterly disaster preparedness exercise. You know what to do, who to
contact, and the location of the alternate office to use in case of an
emergency. You are concerned, but you are confident that you have a plan
in place. As a key member of the organization’s crisis communication
team (CMT), you know your role. You help management immediately prepare
a news release and update the company’s website with factual information
on the who, what, when, and where details of the event. You use social
media, such as Twitter and Facebook, and traditional media, such as
radio and TV, to inform internal stakeholder groups (e.g., senior
leadership, employees, and investors) and external stakeholder groups
(e.g., customers, clients, local officials, and the general public) with
appropriate key messages. During times of crisis, the public relations
specialist helps management communicate that sound, safe, and
responsible actions are being used to protect and defend the
organization from harm or damage. Crisis communication is one of the
many specialized areas or functions of public relations. This course
will specifically focus on the use of crisis communication to protect
and defend a company or organization facing a problem or challenge that
threatens to harm its brand or reputation. As a sudden and unexpected
serious event, a *crisis* can fall into four categories: acts of God,
mechanical problems, human error, and management decision or indecision.
You may recall examples of crisis in news media coverage of killer
earthquakes and tsunamis, grounded airplanes, stranded cruise ship
passengers, and senior government officials or CEOs who are fired or
asked to resign following adulterous affairs. If you want to learn to
become a professional public relations specialist, it is important to
have a basic understanding of the important role public relations has in
helping guide a company or organization through a crisis or serious
event. This course is designed for practical applications of crisis
communication principles. This course will explain what communication
problems look like, the different phases of crises, how to deal with
them, and how to anticipate crises as part of conducting effective
public relations program. It will also explain the role of a crisis
communication team and teach you how to write a crisis communication
plan. Most importantly, it will emphasize the value and importance of
using social media in a crisis communication plan and in marketing.
Through case studies, you will examine best practices that have worked
for others. A diverse selection of resource materials will help guide
and supplement your understanding for practical application. This course
will cover certain crisis cases, including BP’s oil rig explosion, a
Wendy’s customer’s false claims, and a UPS employee strike. After
completing this course, you may also be interested in conducting your
own research to find examples of other crisis cases, such as: Carnival’s
Costa Concordia cruise ship, Lance Armstrong and the Livestrong
Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Penn State, or Toyota’s 2010
recalls. These cases will give you an appreciation and understanding of
the necessity to have a well-thought out crisis communication management
system. The overall goal of the course is to help develop your skills
and abilities as part of a crisis management team to help an
organization or company develop a credible and tested communication plan
to effectively respond to a crisis.
